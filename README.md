# 🇳🇱 Dutch Language Pack for [Flarum](http://flarum.org/)

![Latest update](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/flarum-lang/dutch) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen) ![Translated](https://weblate.rob006.net/widgets/flarum/nl/svg-badge.svg) ![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/flarum-lang/dutch)

Extension to localize the Flarum forum software and its official extensions into Dutch.

## Installation

### Using Composer

Flarum uses Composer to manage its dependencies and extensions. The Dutch language pack, available [on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/flarum-lang/dutch), is also manageable with Composer. Make sure that [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed on your machine, then run the following command in the location where Flarum is installed:

```
composer require flarum-lang/dutch:*
```

### Manual Installation

You can also manually ADD the Dutch language pack as Flarum's dependency. Open the *composer.json* file located at the root of your Flarum installation (not the language pack one!) with [a text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors), then add to the list of Flarum's dependencies (which are listed below the `"require"` property) the following line in a new line:

```
"flarum-lang/dutch": "*"
```
